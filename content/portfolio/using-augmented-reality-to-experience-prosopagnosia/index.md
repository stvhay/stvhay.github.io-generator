+++

This project aims to let people see through another's eyes. We will simulate the subjective experience of face blindness (prosopagnosia) through augmented reality (AR) manipulation of facial features. Informed by research on neural encoding in the fusiform face area, the system captures live video input and distorts faces by altering their geometry and texture. The aim of the project is to accurately simulate the subjective experience of someone with prosopagnosia, allowing for an immersive exploration of how disrupted facial recognition impacts perception and social interaction. By merging neuroscience insights with AR technology, this work contributes to both the artistic exploration and scientific understanding of face perception disorders.
