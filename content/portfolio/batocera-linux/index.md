I wanted to make a retrogaming platform for my nephews, and this project turned
into me briefly maintaining a fork of the Linux [kernel](https://github.com/stvhay/kernel)
for the Batocera project, as well as user contributions to the [Armbian](https://github.com/stvhay/armbian-indiedroid-nova) project and more minimal [Deb Image Builder](https://github.com/stvhay/debian-image-builder)
project. My work was focused on ARM boards with the RK3588(S) chipset, such as
the [Rock 5B](https://radxa.com/products/rock5/5b/) and [Indiedroid Nova](https://indiedroid.us).
I also managed to get a cool patch into the underlying buildroot tool to
bidirectionally graph package dependencies.

As for the retrogames, the kids love 'em.
