This is a browser Javascript template to administer and score an online user
"quiz". The code supports multi-dimensional tests, with the ability to sum up
scores across the dimensions and establish minimum and maximum criteria for
each.

Sample quizzes are provided for aphantasia (VVIQ) and personality (OCEAN)
tests. The VVIQ test is online [here](https://www.sadied.com/viv-q).
