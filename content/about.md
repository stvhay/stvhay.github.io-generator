I am a multidisciplinary engineer with extensive experience in energy systems,
nuclear power, and data science. I hold degrees in computer science, electrical
engineering, mechanical engineering, and business. I've founded innovative
teams like the Digital Intelligence group at Fluence Energy to integrate
machine learning into grid-scale energy storage, and led critical initiatives
such as the StuxNet response for the nuclear Navy.

I am seeking a PhD to apply my knowledge of artifical intelligence to model 
perception in the human visual system. Recent advances in neural network 
training methods, architectures, and fundamental neural units, are revolutionizing
our own understanding of the human brain, and allowing us to probe our understanding
of subjective experience, perceptual diversity, and human brain neural architectures.
