I'm Steve, an engineer learning neuroscience.

After twenty years working on complex systems—nuclear reactors, grid-scale batteries, machine learning—I'm pursuing a PhD in computational neuroscience, with interests in early visual processing.

This site is where I write about what I'm learning, share projects I'm working on, and think through ideas in public.
