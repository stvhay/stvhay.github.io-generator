I am a multidisciplinary engineer with extensive experience in energy systems,
nuclear power, and data science. I hold degrees in computer science, electrical
engineering, mechanical engineering, and business. I've founded innovative
teams like the Digital Intelligence group at Fluence Energy to integrate
machine learning into grid-scale energy storage, and led critical initiatives
such as the StuxNet response for the nuclear Navy.

I am seeking a PhD to more deeply understand the impact of Artifical
Intelligence on society at large. I am interested creating explainable and
traceable AI systems for use in safety critical applications, defining risk
evaluation strategies for deploying AI systems, and using neural models to make
digital art that deepens our understanding of perceptual diversity and
subjective experience. ([CV](/docs/cv-steve-hay.pdf "Steve Hay CV"))
