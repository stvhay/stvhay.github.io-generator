    \begin{multicols}{2}
        \noindent \textit{Engineer and researcher transitioning to computational neuroscience, with interests in the neural computations underlying visual processing. Brings over two decades of experience in complex systems engineering, machine learning, and multi-framework integration---skills directly applicable to multi-scale neural modeling.}\\
        
        \noindent{At Fluence Energy, co-developed a machine learning system using recurrent neural networks (GRU/LSTM architectures) to predict thermal dynamics in grid-scale battery systems, achieving a 45\% reduction in cooling costs. Founded the company's Digital Intelligence group, which authored two patents pending. This work revealed the tension between models optimized for output metrics and those that explain underlying dynamics---a challenge central to computational neuroscience.}\\
        
        \noindent{In the Navy, worked alongside scientists at national laboratories on nuclear engineering topics and integrated systems-theoretical safety frameworks (Dr.\ Nancy Leveson's STAMP methodology) into analysis processes---developing the capacity to integrate multiple analytical frameworks applicable to multi-scale neural modeling.}\\
        
        \noindent{Currently auditing coursework in neural computation and cognitive neuroscience, attending graduate seminars at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, and actively engaging with the vision science research community.}

            Co-developed a machine learning system to optimize cooling for grid-scale battery storage. Extracted six months of operational time-series data and trained a deep neural network (GRU/LSTM architecture) to predict future battery temperatures given HVAC status, system demand history, weather data, and operational variables. Coupled the predictive model with a simulated annealing optimizer to minimize cooling cost while maximizing system availability. Results: 45\% reduction in cooling costs from baseline, 30\% improvement over optimized daily schedules, with no impact on availability or battery warranty.
